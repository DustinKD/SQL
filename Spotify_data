For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


select * from spotifydata


SELECT artist_name
popularity
FROM spotifydata                                            -- top ten by popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;


Select artist_name, AVG(Danceability) AS AVG_Dance
from spotifydata
group by artist_name                                            --average danceability by artist
order by AVG_Dance Desc

Select count(distinct artist_name)
from spotifydata

Select AVG(danceability)
from spotifydata

Select *
from spotifydata

Select track_name, popularity
from spotifydata
order by popularity desc

SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)                        --First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track
,avg(energy)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name


select artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS Avg_pop                --I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by Avg_pop desc limit 10
